###react-file-explorer
A performant and feature-ful file explorer based on top of facebook's [FixedDataTable](http://facebook.github.io/).

Features
- Show file heirarchy
- Allow movement of files/folders through drag and drop
- Allow copy/cut pasting of files into other folders using keyboard shortcuts (command+c/ctrl+c)
- Keyboard movement of selection
- Sorting
- Resizable columns

Still very much a work in progress.

How to check it out -

```bash
# npm i
# npm start
// go to http://localhost:3000
```
